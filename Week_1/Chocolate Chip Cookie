Ingredients
Butter – see my tips below
White Sugar AND Brown Sugar – the combo makes the best fluffy chocolate chip cookies
Whole Egg – be sure to buy large eggs
All Purpose Flour – be sure to measure it correctly
Salt – for flavor, especially since using unsalted butter.
Baking Soda – just 1/2 teaspoon so you don’t get flat cookies.
Vanilla – be sure to buy pure vanilla extract
Chocolate Chips – use your favorite milk chocolate chips or semi-sweet chocolate chips.


Instructions
Melt your butter in a large bowl. You don’t even need to use a mixer unless you want to.
Add white sugar and brown sugar to the melted butter and stir until combined.
Add a whole egg, baking soda, vanilla, and salt. Stir.
Combine flour into the wet ingredients. Again, you don’t need a mixer unless you want to use one.
Stir in chocolate chips or chocolate chunks.
Scoop balls of dough in desired size and place on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper or a baking mat. Chill the dough at least 30 minutes!
